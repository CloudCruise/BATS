## Framework

- Next.js
- App router

## File Structure

- We generally put all code related to a net-new feature into a folder within `frontend/app/`
- Check out other features to learn about the common structure
- Name new files in camelCase.
- Do not use components in the /src/components/ai-elements folder, but use it as inspiration in designing new components.

## Components

- We use Shadcn/ui
  - Components in `@/components/ui`
  - If a component is not installed yet, ask the user to install it for you
- When creating new custom components that generalize, we add them with a generalizable naming to `@/components`

## Styling

- We use Tailwind CSS
- We use a standard color palette which automatically handles light/dark mode
- Follow the existing design system and color scheme
- Do _not_ add comments to the code.
- Avoid typing objects as any.
